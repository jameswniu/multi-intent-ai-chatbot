# Multi-Intent AI Chatbot Assistant

### Executive Summary
The Multi-Intent AI Chatbot Assistant helps service and analytics teams answer both product-related and account-specific questions with accuracy, compliance, and scalability.

It evolves in three clear stages:

1. **Phase 1 – Pre-LLM (Deterministic Pilot)**  
   A rule-based, offline system using FAISS vector retrieval and keyword-to-SQL mapping.

2. **Phase 2 – Full LLM (Production Deployment)**  
   A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) platform with microservices, continuous learning, and observability.

3. **Phase 3 – Scaling & Orchestration (Kubernetes)**  
   Converts Phase 2 containers into a fully orchestrated, auto-scaling platform.

## Phase 1 – Pre-LLM Pilot (4–6 weeks)
*(existing section retained — no change needed)*

---

## Phase 2 – Full LLM Production (3–6 months)
*(existing section retained — no change needed)*

---

## Phase 3 – Scaling & Orchestration (6–12 months)

**Purpose**  
Transform the Phase 2 LLM-augmented system into a fully orchestrated, self-healing, multi-node platform running on Kubernetes.

**Core Stack Enhancements**  
- Kubernetes (GKE / EKS / AKS) for orchestration  
- Helm Charts for deployment automation  
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for load scaling  
- Ingress Controller + Load Balancer for routing  
- GitOps (Argo CD / Flux) for continuous rollout  
- Centralized observability with Prometheus and Grafana  

**Deliverables**  
1. Multi-node Kubernetes cluster with all chatbot services containerized.  
2. Helm-managed deployments and versioning.  
3. Auto-scaling and rolling updates based on load.  
4. Unified monitoring and logging across services.  

**Success Metrics**

| Objective | Metric | Target | Owner |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Horizontal Scaling | Pods auto-expand under load | ≤ 1 min reaction | DevOps |
| Reliability | SLA Uptime | ≥ 99.95 % | DevOps |
| Cost Efficiency | Node Utilization | ≥ 80 % | Finance |
| Deployment Speed | Zero-Downtime Rollouts | 100 % success | Platform Team |

**Outcome**  
A cloud-native, self-healing AI assistant that can scale globally across regions while maintaining governance, performance, and cost efficiency.

- Kubernetes YAML samples → (./phase3_scaling/deployment.yaml)  
- Monitoring dashboards → (./phase3_scaling/observability/)  
- GitOps pipeline stubs → (./phase3_scaling/ci_cd/)  
These placeholders can be expanded once the orchestration layer is implemented.
